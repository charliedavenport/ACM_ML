    "**Operations (ops) are the nodes of our graph.** They take in Tensor objects as input, and produce Tensor objects as output. Ops represent our inputs, variables, and operations such as matrix multiplication (tf.matmul) and activation functions (e.g. tf.nn.relu). Additionally, common operators such as ```*```, ```+```, and ```-``` are overloaded with tf.Operations. Once a Graph has been launched in a tf.Session, we can run our ops, by calling ```tf.Session().run(my_op)``` or ```my_op.run()```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tensors are the edges of our graph.** A tf.Tensor object represents the output of a TensorFlow operation. We construct our data-flow graph by connecting the output of one op to the input of another. A Tensor represents a multidimensional array, but does not itself hold a value. Rather, it provides a means to compute the value in a graph session. The result of evaluating a Tensor object is a numpy array. We get this result by calling ```tf.Session().run(my_tensor)``` or by calling ```my_tensor.eval()```\n",

    "A tf.Variable op represents a Tensor whose value can be changed during graph session. We can assign a value by calling the ```assign()``` method. When we declare our variable, we pass in an initial value, which is a Tensor of any type and shape. Just like any Tensor, variables created with Variable() can be used as inputs for other Ops in the graph. **Variables must be initialized before you can call an op that uses their value.** Every variable object contains an initializer op, which we'll run at the beginning of a graph session.\n",
